<p><span class="smcap">Robert Gray</span> was a Riverdale
boy, and a very smart
one too. Very likely most of
my readers will think he was
altogether too smart for his
years, when they have read the
story I have to tell about him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>Robert was generally a very
good boy, but, like a great
many persons who are older
and ought to be wiser than
he was, he would sometimes
get very queer notions into
his head, which made him act
very strangely.</p>

<p>He was born on the Fourth
of July, which may be the
reason why he was so smart,
though I do not think it was.
He could make boxes and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
carts, windmills and water-wheels,
and ever so many
other things.</p>

<p>Behind his father’s house
there was a little brook, flowing
into the river. In this
stream Robert had built a
dam, and put up a water-wheel, which kept turning
day and night till a freshet
came and swept it into the
river.</p>

<p>His father was a carpenter,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
and Robert spent a great part
of his leisure hours in the
shop, inventing or constructing
queer machines, of which
no one but himself knew the
use; and I am not sure that
he always knew himself.</p>

<p>On his birthday, when Robert
was eleven years old, his
oldest brother, who lived in
Boston, sent him a copy of
Robinson Crusoe as a birthday
present. Almost every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
child reads this book, and I
suppose there is not another
book in the world which children
like to read so well as
this.</p>

<p>It is the story of a man who
was wrecked on an island, far
away from the main land, and
on which no human being
lived. The book tells how
Robinson Crusoe lived on the
island, what he had to eat,
and how he obtained it; how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
he built a boat, and could not
get it into the water, and then
built another, and did get it
into the water; about his dog
and goats, his cat and his parrots,
and his Man Friday.</p>

<p>The poor man lived alone
for a long time, and most of
us would think he could not
have been very happy, away
from his country and friends,
with no one to speak to but
his cat and goats, and his Man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
Friday, and none of them could
understand him.</p>

<p>Robert Gray didn’t think
so. He read the book through
in two or three days after he
received it, and thought Robinson
Crusoe must have had
a nice time of it with his cat
and his goats, and his Man
Friday.</p>

<p>He was even silly enough
to wish himself on a lonely
island, away from his father<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
and mother. He thought he
should be happy there in
building his house, and roaming
over his island in search
of food, and in sailing on the
sea, fishing, and hunting for
shell fish.</p>

<p>Then he read the book
through again, and the more
he read the more he thought
Crusoe was a great man, and
the more he wished to be
like him, and to live on an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
island far away from other
people.</p>

<p>“Have you read Robinson
Crusoe?” said Robert Gray
to Frank Lee, as they were
walking home from school
one day.</p>

<p>“Yes, three times,” replied
Frank; and his eyes sparkled
as he thought of the pleasure
which the book had afforded
him.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve read it twice,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
and I think it is a first-rate
book.”</p>

<p>“So do I; and I mean to
read it again some time.”</p>

<p>“How should you like to
live like Robinson Crusoe, all
alone on an island by yourself?”
asked Robert, very
gravely.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know as I
should like it overmuch. I
should want some of Jenny’s
doughnuts and apple pies.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>“Pooh! who cares for
them?” said Robert, with a
sneer.</p>

<p>“I do, for one.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t. I would
just as lief have oysters and
cocoanuts, fish and grapes, and
such things.”</p>

<p>“Without any butter, or
sugar, or molasses?”</p>

<p>“I could get along without
them.”</p>

<p>“Then there would be great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
storms, and you would get
wet and be cold.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t mind that.”</p>

<p>“Suppose you should be
sick—have the measles, the
hooping-cough, or the scarlet
fever? Who would take care
of you then?”</p>

<p>“I would take care of myself.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you could; but I
think you would wish your
mother was on the island with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
you in that case,” said Frank,
with a laugh.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe I should;
at any rate, I should like to
try it.”</p>

<p>“It is all very pretty to
read about, but I don’t believe
I should like to try it.
What would you do, Robert,
when the Indians came to the
island?”</p>

<p>“I would do just as Robinson
Crusoe did. I would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
shoot as many of them as I
could. I would catch one of
them, and make him be my
Man Friday.”</p>

<p>“Suppose they should happen
to shoot you instead; and
then broil you for their supper?
Don’t you think you
would ‘make a dainty dish to
set before the king’?”</p>

<p>“I am certain that I could
get along just as well as Robinson
Crusoe did.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>“Perhaps not; every one
don’t get out of a scrape as
easily as Robinson Crusoe
did. I know one thing—I
shall not go on any desolate
island to live as long as I can
help it.”</p>

<p>“I think I should have a
first-rate time on one,” said
Robert, as he turned down the
street which led to his father’s
house.</p>

<p>The next week the long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
summer vacation began, and
Robert read Robinson Crusoe
through again from beginning
to end. He spent almost all
his time in thinking about
the man alone on the island;
and I dare say he very often
dreamed about the goats, the
cat, the parrot, and Man Friday.</p>

<p>He used to lie for hours
together under the great elm
tree behind the house fancying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
what a famous Crusoe he
would make; and wishing he
could be cast away upon a
lonely island, and there live
in a cave, with a cat and a
parrot.</p>

<p>It was certainly very silly
of him to spend the greater
part of his time in dreaming
about such things, when he
ought to have been thankful
for his comfortable and
pleasant home, and the company<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
of his parents, and his
brothers and sisters, and for
all the good things which God
had given him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert Gray</span> wanted to be
a Robinson Crusoe, and he
actually went so far as to
form a plan by which he
could live on an island, sleep
in a cave, and have no companions
but a dog and an old
cat.</p>

<p>Of course he did not tell
any body about this famous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
plan, for fear his friends might
find it out, and prevent him
from becoming a Crusoe. But
he went to work, and got every
thing ready as fast as he
could. He was a smart boy,
as I have said before, and his
plan was very well laid for a
child.</p>

<p>He meant to be Robinson
Crusoe, Jr., but he was not
quite willing to go upon the
island without any tools to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
work with, or any thing to eat,
after he arrived. I think, if he
could, he would have made sure
of most of the comforts of life.</p>

<p>Mr. Gray’s shop was only a
short distance from the river.
The little brook in which Robert
placed his water-wheel,
widened into a pretty large
stream near the shop. Here
Mr. Crusoe, Jr., intended to
build a raft, which should bear
him to the lonely island.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>Near the middle of the great
pond, which my young friends
will find described in The
Young Voyagers, there was a
small island, which Robert
had chosen for his future
home, and where he was to
be “monarch of all he surveyed.”</p>

<p>After Frank Lee’s unfortunate
cruise down the river,
Robert had some doubts about
being able to reach the island.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
But these did not prevent
him from trying to carry out
his plan. He might, perhaps,
get wrecked, as Joe Birch had
been; but if he did, it would
be so much the more like
Robinson Crusoe,—only a
rock, with the water knee
deep upon it, was not a very
good place to be “monarch
of all he surveyed.”</p>

<p>Robert’s father and mother
had gone to visit his uncle in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
the State of New York, and
were to be absent two weeks.
This seemed like a good time
for his great enterprise, as his
oldest sister was the only person
at home besides himself,
and she was too busy to watch
him very closely.</p>

<p>He worked away on his raft
for two days before he finished
it, for he did not mean to go
to sea, as he called it to himself,
in such a shabby craft as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
that in which Joe had been
wrecked. He had tools from
the shop, a hammer, and plenty
of nails, and he made the
raft very strong and safe.</p>

<p>It was raised above the
water, so that the top was
dry when he stood upon it;
and to make it more secure,
he put a little fence all round
it, to prevent him from slipping
off if the craft should
strike upon a rock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>Then he made two oars with
which he could move and steer
the raft. He also nailed a box
upon the platform, upon which
he could sit. When this queer
ark was done, he pushed it
out into the stream, and made
a trial trip as far as the river,
and rowed it back to the place
from which he started.</p>

<p>From the barn he took two
horse-blankets, for his bed on
the island, and placed them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
on the raft. He got a tin cup
and a kettle from the house,
as well as several other things
which he thought he might
need. A small hatchet and
some nails from the shop completed
his outfit. All these
articles were secured on the
raft, just before dark, and the
next morning he intended to
start for the island.</p>

<p>Robert was so tired after
the hard work he had done<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
upon the raft, that he slept
like a rock all night, and did
not wake up till his sister
called him to breakfast. He
had intended to start very
early in the morning, but this
part of his plan had failed.</p>

<p>After breakfast, he took
twenty cents which he had
saved towards buying a book
called The Swiss Family Robinson,
which Frank Lee told
him was something like Robinson<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
Crusoe, and went to the
grocery store to buy some provisions.</p>

<p>He bought a sheet of gingerbread,
some crackers, and
a piece of cheese, and ran
across the fields with them
to the brook. He was very
careful to keep away from the
house, so that his sister should
not see him. Having placed
these things in the box on
the raft, so that they would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
be safe, he went back to the
house once more.</p>

<p>“Puss, puss, puss,” said he;
and presently the old black
cat came purring and mewing
up to him, and rubbing
her head against his legs.</p>

<p>Poor pussy had not the least
idea that she was destined to
be the companion of a Robinson
Crusoe; so she let him take
her up in his arms. If she had
only known what a scrape she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
was about to get into, I am
sure she would not have let
Mr. Crusoe, Jr., put one of his
fingers upon her.</p>

<p>“Trip, Trip, Trip,—come
here, Trip,” said he to the
spaniel dog that was sleeping
on the door mat.</p>

<p>Trip had no more idea than
pussy of the famous plan in
which he was to play a part;
so he waked up and followed
his young master. I don’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
believe Trip had any taste for
Crusoe life; and he would
have liked to know where
his beef and bones were to
come from, for he was not
very fond of gingerbread and
crackers.</p>

<p>If pussy didn’t “smell a
rat” when they reached the
raft, it was because there was
no rat for her to smell; but
she showed a very proper
spirit, and, by her scratching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
and snarling, showed that she
did not like the idea of sailing
down the river on a
raft.</p>

<p>Robert did not heed her
objections; and what do you
think he did with poor pussy?
Why, he put her in the box
with the crackers and gingerbread
and cheese! Trip, having
a decided taste for the
water, did not object to going
upon the raft. Yet, judging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
from the way he looked up
into his master’s face, he wondered
what was “in the wind,”
and what big thing was going
to be done.</p>

<p>“Now, Trip, we are all ready
for a start,” said Robert, as he
stepped upon the raft. “You
needn’t scratch and cry so,
pussy. Nobody is going to
hurt you.”</p>

<p>Trip looked up in his face
and wagged his tail, and pussy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
scratched and howled, and refused
to be comforted. But
Trip had the advantage of
pussy very much in one respect,
for, when he became
sick of the adventure, he
could jump into the water
and swim ashore.</p>

<p>Robert, however, gave little
thought or heed at this
moment to the wishes or
comfort of his two companions,
for his mind was wholly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
taken up with the preparations
for the grand departure.</p>

<p>All was now ready; Robert
pushed off the raft, and it floated
slowly down the stream.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> river was broad and
deep, but Robert was not
afraid. He had been on the
water a great deal for a little
boy, and he was sure that
his raft was strong enough to
bear a pretty hard knock upon
the rocks.</p>

<p>Poor pussy kept up a constant
crying, in the box, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
once in a while she scratched,
with all her might, against the
sides; but she could not get
out.</p>

<p>Trip behaved himself much
better, but he gazed up in his
young master’s face all the
time, and did not know what
to make of this very singular
voyage.</p>

<p>Robert was much pleased
with his success thus far, and
was satisfied that he should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
make a very good Robinson
Crusoe, Jr. The raft worked
quite well, and with the great
oar at the stern, he could steer
it as easily as though it had
been a real boat.</p>

<p>He had not yet reached the
dangerous part of the river,
which was called the <i>Rapids</i>.
This was the place where Joe
Birch had been wrecked. He
had some doubts about being
able to pass with safety between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
the rocks, which here
rose above the surface of the
water.</p>

<p>But he was a bold, brave
boy, and he was almost sure
that, if any thing happened,
he could swim ashore.</p>

<p>As he thought of the raft
being dashed to pieces against
a rock, he wondered what
would become of poor pussy.</p>

<p>He did not want to drown
her; so he decided to give her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
a fair chance to save her life
in case of any accident. He
opened the box, and pussy
was glad enough to get out.</p>

<p>As she jumped from the
box, Robert saw that she had
made a sad mess of the provisions
he had obtained for
use on the island. She had
scratched open the papers, and
the gingerbread was broken
into a hundred pieces. The
cheese was all mashed up and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
ground in with the gingerbread,
and the whole mass
was well mixed with black
hairs from the cat’s back.</p>

<p>Robert was so angry when
he saw the wreck within the
box, that he was tempted to
throw pussy overboard for the
mischief she had done. But
the thought that it was not
the cat’s fault saved her from
a cold bath.</p>

<p>It was not of her own will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
that she had taken up her
quarters in the box. She did
not want to go in there, or
stay there after she was in;
and all the mischief had been
done by her efforts to be free.</p>

<p>Pussy was even more astonished
at the prospect around
her than the dog, and she
jumped from one end of the
raft to the other a dozen
times, seeking to find some
way to escape. She was no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
sailor, on the one hand, and
did not like her position in
the midst of the waters. And
she did not like the idea of
wetting her soft black coat
by swimming ashore, on the
other hand.</p>

<p>When she found there was
no way to get ashore without
taking to the water, she took
her stand next to Trip, and
began to mew in a most
sorrowful manner. The dog<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
looked at her, and bow-wowed
two or three times, as much
as to say, “What are you
afraid of, pussy? Don’t you
see I’m not scared?”</p>

<p>Robert went to work upon
the contents of the box, to
save some of his food, if he
could. The hatchet and the
nails were covered with soft
cheese, and it took him some
time to put things in order
again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>While he was busy at the
box, he did not pay much
attention to the raft, and it
kept turning round and round,
as it floated with the current
down the river.</p>

<p>While the little navigator
was thus engaged, the raft
bumped against something,
and Robert sprang to his feet.
The whirling craft had run
up against the shore, and got
aground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>This did not hurt the raft
any; but pussy, who had kept
both of her sharp eyes fixed
upon the land all the time,
no sooner saw the vessel touch,
than she improved her chance
and jumped ashore.</p>

<p>“Pussy, pussy, pussy,” called
Robert, when he saw that one
of his companions had given
him the slip.</p>

<p>It was of no use to call her,
for she was scampering away<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
as fast as her nimble feet
would carry her in the direction
of home. She had no
idea of sharing the fortunes
of Mr. Robinson Crusoe, Jr.,
on his lonely island.</p>

<p>“That’s real mean—isn’t it,
Trip?” said he, as he turned
to the dog.</p>

<p>But it was very clear that
Trip did not think it was
mean, for he was in the very
act of springing ashore himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>“Here, Trip. Come here,
sir,” cried he, as he tried to
get hold of the dog’s collar.</p>

<p>Trip did not stop to hear
any argument on the subject,
but, with a long leap, placed
himself on the shore. He did
not run off, as pussy had done,
but stood on the bank of the
river, and barked with all his
might.</p>

<p>The raft had now floated off
a short distance, and Robert<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
took his oars and rowed it to
the shore, for he could not
think of such a thing as losing
both of his friends, and before
he landed on the island.</p>

<p>“Come here, Trip. Poor
fellow. Come here, sir,” said
he, whistling, and patting his
knees, to entice the dog to
him.</p>

<p>Pushing the raft up a little
distance upon the shore, he
stepped on the beach to catch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
the dog. As he did so, the
raft, lightened by the removal
of his weight, slid off and
went to sea again “on its own
hook.”</p>

<p>As the loss of his vessel
seemed to be a greater misfortune
than the loss of the
dog, he turned from the latter
to recover the former.</p>

<p>The raft floated out about
a rod from the shore, and began
to go down stream. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
water was quite shallow, and
Robert waded in till he got
hold of the truant craft; but
in attempting to jump upon
the platform, he slipped, and
went all over into the water.</p>

<p>His courage was good, however,
and he managed to pick
himself up, and climb upon
the raft. The ducking did
him no harm; but the day
was cool, and his wet clothes
did not add to his comfort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>Pulling to the shore again,
he fastened the raft to a tree
with a rope he had brought for
the purpose. Taking off all
his clothes, he wrung them as
dry as he could, and put them
on again.</p>

<p>“Now, come here, Trip,”
said he to the dog, which
had been watching all his
movements. “Now we will
try again. You needn’t try
to sneak off, for you are going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
with me to the island, any
how.”</p>

<p>After some coaxing he got
near enough to Trip to seize
hold of his collar, to which
he tied the rope that fastened
the raft.</p>

<p>“I didn’t think you would
be so mean as to run away
and leave me, as pussy did,”
said Robert, as he dragged
Trip upon the raft once more.
“But you shall go with me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
on the voyage, whether you
like it or not.”</p>

<p>Having secured his prisoner,
he pushed off again, and
the raft floated slowly down
the river. He passed the
Rapids in safety, though the
raft got two or three pretty
hard knocks upon the rocks.</p>

<p>When he reached the pond,
he had to take his oars, for
the current would not carry
him to the island, where he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
wished to go. He had to
work very hard for as much
as an hour, before he could
bring the raft to the island.
But at last he reached it, and
began to feel that he was
“monarch of all he surveyed.”</p>

</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Now</span>, Trip, we have arrived
at our future home.
We must go to work and
put things to rights,” said
Robert, as he released the
dog, and fastened the raft to
a tree.</p>

<p>Trip wagged his tail, and
jumped upon the land, as
though he entered heartily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
into the spirit of the adventure.
But I think if Trip
could have spoken, and had
had the courage to utter his
whole mind, he would have
said,—</p>

<p>“Young master, you are a
fool. What do you want to
come here for, where there
isn’t any body or any thing?
You were a great deal better
off at home, and I think you
are a real silly fellow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>But as Trip could not speak,
he didn’t say a word; and I
am afraid his actions did not
express his real feelings, for
he looked happy and contented.</p>

<p>Robert’s first step after he
landed was to explore the
island, just as Robinson Crusoe,
Senior, had done his domain.
He pushed his way,
followed by Trip, through the
bushes that covered the island.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
He wanted to find a cave; but
there was not even a rock to
be found.</p>

<p>“Well, Trip, I don’t see
what we shall do for a house,”
said he, when he returned to
the landing-place. “There is,
certainly, no cave here. What
shall we do, Trip?”</p>

<p>The dog wagged his tail,
and barked, as though he understood
the question; but he
did not mention any way to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
overcome the difficulty. Instead
of trying to help his
master to a plan, he leaped
upon the raft, and seated himself
on the box.</p>

<p>I dare say this was Trip’s
notion of their next move,—that
Robert should get upon
the raft, and make his way
home as fast as he could.</p>

<p>“We won’t do any thing
of the sort, Trip. Do you
think I’m going home again?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
No, sir. I’m Robinson Crusoe,
Jr.”</p>

<p>“Bow, wow,” replied Trip;
which, being interpreted, undoubtedly
meant, “Do come
along, master. Let us go
home.”</p>

<p>“No, you don’t,” said Robert.
“Wouldn’t the fellows
laugh at me if they should
find me coming back now!
I’ll tell you what we’ll do,
Trip. We can take the boards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
in the raft and use them to
build a house. That is just
the idea. We won’t stop to
think about it, either, but go
to work, and do the job at
once, for we want the house
to sleep in to-night.”</p>

<p>Robert then carried the
box and the various articles
with which the raft was loaded
to the shore, and placed
them near the spot where he
intended to build his house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>This was just the kind of
work that pleased Robert,
and he was as much excited
as though he were going to
Europe, or to do some other
great thing. Throwing off his
coat, he seized the hatchet and
went to work with a zeal that
promised soon to give him a
house.</p>

<p>The raft was torn in pieces,
and the boards and timbers
of which it was made carried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
to the site of the new dwelling.
Robert had hardly finished
this part of the job,
before a thought struck him.</p>

<p>At the most, his stock of
food would not last him more
than two or three days; and
in his survey of the island he
had seen neither grapes nor
berries, upon which he had
expected to live when the
crackers and gingerbread were
all gone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>As this thought struck him,
he sat down upon the ground,
and began to look quite sad.
He had destroyed the raft,
which it had taken him two
days to build. He was acting
like a man who locks
himself into a prison, and
then throws the key out the
window.</p>

<p>“I don’t know but we are
getting into a bad scrape,
Trip,” said he, as the dog<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
seated himself in front of him,
and looked up into his face as
if to ask him what he meant
to do next.</p>

<p>Trip wagged his tail, and
did not seem to be at all concerned
about the future. No
doubt he felt able to swim
to the main shore.</p>

<p>“But I’m not going to back
out now, I can tell you, Trip.
I’m going to have a time of
it, any how. When I get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
back, if I ever do go back, I
want to tell the fellows I
enjoyed it first rate, and then
they can’t laugh at me.”</p>

<p>It was now nearly noon,
and he decided to dine before
he began to work on the
house. Opening the box, he
took out some crackers and
cheese; and while he ate himself,
he gave Trip his full share.
Robert had worked hard, and
was very hungry; and Trip,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
like any other dog, was always
hungry. The dinner
they ate, therefore, made a
large hole in the stock of
food.</p>

<p>After the meal, they went
down to the bank to take a
drink. Robert took up a dipper
of water, and tried to
drink it, but it was so brackish
that a very little satisfied
him.</p>

<p>By this time he had begun<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
to feel some of the hardships
of Crusoe life. Crackers and
cheese were not very dainty
fare to a boy who had been
used to living upon beefsteak
and hot biscuit; and river
water was not at all like tea
and coffee, or even the water
of his father’s well.</p>

<p>In spite of these difficulties,
Robert went to work like a
hero, and by sunset, he had
finished his house so far as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
he could, for his stock of
boards fell short when he had
covered the top and one side
of the dwelling.</p>

<p>While he was so busy he
had not kept watch of Trip,
and the glutton had gone to
the box in which the gingerbread
and crackers were kept,
and eaten all he could of them.
What he could not eat, he had
munched up, till a decent pig
would have refused to touch it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>“Trip, Trip. Come here,
Trip, you rascal,” cried Robert,
angry enough to kill the
dog, if he had been near.</p>

<p>Trip did not answer to the
call; in fact, after he had eaten
all he could, he quietly slipped
into the water and swam to
the main shore.</p>

<p>Robert sat down, and actually
wept with vexation. Every
thing was spoiled by the
unfeeling conduct on the part<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
of Trip. There was not even
enough for his supper left,
though his hunger made him
partake of some of the cleanest
of the mess.</p>

<p>The sun set, and the darkness
gathered around him.
He now crawled into his new
house, and rolled himself up
in his blanket; but it was very
gloomy, and he was cold and
tired. How different from his
father’s kitchen!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>Robert began to think what
a fool he was, and wished
himself at home with all his
heart. He wondered what
his sister thought had become
of him. Of course she had
missed him before this time,
and very likely she was then
searching for him in the village.
Perhaps the people
would make just such a fuss
as they did when Frank Lee
was lost.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>He had not thought of this
before, and he felt sorry that
he had caused his sister so
much pain and anxiety as his
absence would occasion.</p>

<p>As he shivered with cold,
he came to the conclusion
that it was not so pleasant,
after all, to be a Robinson
Crusoe. The book was all
very well as a story, but it
was not the life he cared to
live.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>He was so cold, he could
not go to sleep. I suppose
some of the boys who read
this will ask why he did not
make a fire. There was a
very good reason. He had
put a bunch of matches into
his pocket in the morning,
but when he fell into the
water they had been completely
soaked, and not one
of them would “go.”</p>

<p>Hour after hour he lay there,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
shivering and weeping, till at
last he fell asleep, so worn
out that he could endure no
more. Do you suppose he
dreamed of Crusoe in his
cave, with his dog and his
parrot?</p>

<p>It is more likely that he
dreamed of his warm bed at
home; of hot biscuit and
new milk, of apple pie and
doughnuts. But after he had
slept an hour or two, he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
awakened by loud calls on
the pond.</p>

<p>He was terrified by the
sounds, and perhaps thought,
at first, that the savages were
coming to have a feast on the
island; but I am sure he had
no wish to procure a Man
Friday from their number.</p>

<p>The noise was made by a
party who were searching for
the young Crusoe. For several
hours the fears of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
sister had filled her with agony.
Some one told her that
her brother had been making
a raft, and she called upon
the neighbors to explore the
river.</p>

<p>She feared that he had been
drowned, for no one thought
of such a thing as that he
had turned Crusoe. It was
possible he had gone ashore,
and got lost; so the people
took boats and went down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
the river, searching closely on
their way.</p>

<p>They were looking for the
raft, and had been down to
the dam below without finding
it. On their way down
they had shouted all the time;
but Robert slept so soundly
that he did not hear them.</p>

<p>On their return they went
nearer to the island, and their
cries had roused him from his
uneasy slumber. Robert heard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
them call his name, and his
fears vanished.</p>

<p>“Halloo!” he shouted in
reply.</p>

<p>“Where are you?” asked
one of the men in the boat.</p>

<p>“On the island.”</p>

<p>In a moment more, the
boat touched the shore, where
Robinson Crusoe, Jr., shivering
with cold, was waiting
for them.</p>

<p>“What in the world are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
you doing here? Where is
your raft?” asked Mr. Green,
who was in the boat.</p>

<p>“I pulled it to pieces, for
I meant to stay here and be
a Robinson Crusoe,” answered
Robert.</p>

<p>The men laughed at the
idea, and Robert began to
cry again. Finding that Crusoe
felt badly, Mr. Green told
the men not to laugh at him.
So they wrapped him up in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
his blankets, and taking the
rest of his things into the
boat, they rowed back to
Riverdale.</p>

<p>Robert’s sister was glad
enough to see him, so she
did not scold him much; but
for a long time afterwards
the boys in the village called
him Robinson Crusoe, Jr.</p>

<p>He never wanted to live
on a desolate island again,
and said no more about trying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
to catch a Man Friday.
On the contrary, the adventure
caused him to love his
parents and his home more
than ever before.</p>
